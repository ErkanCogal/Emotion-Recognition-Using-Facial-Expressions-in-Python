# Emotion Recognition Using Facial Expressions in Python

This algorithm, which can also be used for real-time emotion recognition systems, consists of the basic prediction building blocks used in machine learning.
The dataset containing human expressions images with a size of approximately 1.5 GB was introduced into the emotion recognition system with image processing techniques.

##  *train_landmarks* files contain result of the prediction in form of confusion matrix 


*I will make the necessary updates soon.*
